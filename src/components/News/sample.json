      "content": "LETHBRIDGE, AB – The Lethbridge Police Service Traffic Response Unit has released more information about a collision between two vehicles that occurred on October 5, 2022 at the intersection of Mayor Magrath Drive South and 26 Avenue South. According to the Traffic Response Unit, a vehicle travelling southbound on Mayor Magrath Drive was turning east onto 26 Avenue when it was struck by a vehicle travelling northbound on Mayor Magrath, resulting in the southbound vehicle ending up in the ditch on the east side of Mayor Magrath Drive. Police say the 89-year-old driver of the southbound vehicle was able to free himself from the vehicle, but the 49-year-old female passenger needed assistance from Lethbridge Fire and Emergency Services. Both were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. The driver of the northbound vehicle, a 49-year-old male, was not injured in the collision. Lethbridge police are continuing their investigation and say they will provide an update when more information becomes available.
